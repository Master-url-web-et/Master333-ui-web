Actions: GitHub-hosted larger runner & network configuration REST APIs (GA)
actions
January 29, 2025
Today, Actions larger runner REST APIs are now generally available. These new APIs empower you to programmatically create larger runners, assign them to a runner group, configure network settings for Azure private networking, and apply these configurations to specific runner groups.

With this release, you can now create and manage runners at scale without using the GitHub interface, saving time and reducing manual effort. Additionally, the APIs offer flexibility to apply network configurations to specific runner groups for Azure private networking, ensuring the desired configurations are available to your development teams.

For more information, please refer to the Actions API documentation and look for the new larger runner and network configuration endpoints. Come join the conversation in the community discussion and share your experience on the new APIs.

EMU enterprise access restrictions via corporate proxies (public preview)
January 28, 2025
enterprise
With this preview, GitHub Enterprise Cloud accounts with Enterprise Managed Users (EMU) can decide to allow EMU enterprise traffic to github.com only via their existing corporate proxies. Unapproved traffic would be blocked.

With enterprise access restrictions via corporate proxies, you can now configure your network proxy or firewall to inject a header into your users’ web and API requests to github.com. This signal tells GitHub to block the request if it is from a user outside of your EMU enterprise – helping ensure that only the accounts you control are used on your corporate network. This enables highly regulated EMU customers to define a secure network strategy in order to reduce the risk of intentional or accidental data leaks by allowing access only to a strictly governed EMU enterprise.

This new network restriction covers API and UI access to github.com and will work in tandem with access rules that enable Copilot traffic to flow properly for enterprise managed users. Copilot access is managed using a different network policy that helps control which version of Copilot (Enterprise, Business, or Individual) is allowed on your network. See Configuring your proxy server or firewall for Copilot for detailed guidance on that GA feature.

This feature is currently available by request to EMU enterprises with licensed users. To request access, contact your account manager in GitHub’s Sales team or sign up here.
